# Terraform OpenVPN Configuration with Load Balancer and Auto Scaling

This Terraform project automates the deployment of an OpenVPN server on Amazon EC2 instances using auto scaling groups, customizes its configuration, attaches a load balancer for scalability, and sets up auto scaling to handle varying loads.

## Overview

This project utilizes various AWS services to create a robust and scalable OpenVPN infrastructure:

- **Auto Scaling Groups**: Auto scaling groups are used to manage the number of EC2 instances serving as OpenVPN servers dynamically. The group automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand, ensuring that the infrastructure can handle varying traffic loads efficiently.

- **Load Balancer**: A load balancer is attached to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the OpenVPN server. This ensures high availability and fault tolerance by routing traffic to healthy instances.

- **Customized OpenVPN Configuration**: The OpenVPN server instances are provisioned with a customized configuration to meet specific requirements such as network settings, encryption protocols, and authentication mechanisms.

By leveraging these AWS services, this Terraform project provides a scalable and reliable solution for deploying and managing an OpenVPN infrastructure in the cloud.
